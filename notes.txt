ReflectAndEvaluate, ShowPlanningAndTimeManagement, ShowEmployability

intro WHAT
Learn and practice using shadow maps

motivation WHY
I can build on top of my recently learned Vulkan knowledge
I can also reuse much of that code, enabling the project to go comparatively further in the same timeframe



work plan HOW
Build a scene; spheres, cubes, perhaps load more complex meshes? Only vertices, no materials etc
Then I will try out things like sub-texel sampling and and and

it's like a magnifying glass

career and skills HOW
Capitalise and expand on my initial graphics skills
They say lighting is super important (it's why deferred rendering is a common approach) so it makes sense for me to study these concepts such as shadows and maybe other effects, specular lighting, bloom




risks WHAT
I think the main risk whenever working to a deadline, especially when aiming to learn something new is that I can underestimate how much I can do in the timeframe; there are lots of unknowns; that's kind of the point of this sort of project. I've structured this project so that I get the basics done first (classical shadow mapping) then I can squeeze in as many incremental changes as the time allows.
